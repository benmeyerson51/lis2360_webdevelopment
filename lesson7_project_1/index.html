         <p><em><strong>The NBA is in an analytics revolution,</strong></em> similar to baseball in the early 2000's with the Oakland A's "moneyball" season. It starts Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, who figured out how important the three-point jumper  is. </p>
        <p><em>Last year in the NBA more than 1/3 of shots taken were three-pointers,</em> versus in 2012 when 1/5 of shots attempted were three-pointers. The Houston Rockets actually attempted more three-pointers than two-pointers last season.   </p>
        
        <p> Morey, the GM of the Rockets, figured out that because you get 50% more points from three (when compared to a two point shot) it is more efficent than every two-point shot other than layups and dunks. More specifically the Rockets (and others) leanred that three-pointers taken from the corner have the highest rate of going in and were more valuable.  </p>
        <p>The NBA is evolving and there will be more discoveries along the way, the point is the league is growing very fast. Nearly every team has an analytics team trying to figure out any advantage they can. </p>

        <p>How NBA teams use analytics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Selecting potential draft picks</li>
            <li> Signing players in free agency</li>
            <li> Finding the most efficent shot </li>
            <li> Matchups against defenders</li>
            <li> When to rest players </li>
             </ol>

        <p>Kids growing up playing basketball now aren't going to try to be LeBron James, they'll want to be Steph Curry becuase all they'll want to do is shoot three's. <strong>Growing up you can't be 6'8 250, but you can learn how to shoot three's from every where on the court</strong>.
